# Regional Trends and Analysis of Spotify 2024 Top Songs

### Goal

Investigate how musical preferences vary across different geographical locations and build a Binomial Logistic Regression Model to help predict a song's potential popularity based on different audio features, by leveraging the Top Spotify Songs in 73 Countries.

### Data Source
